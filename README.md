Hi, Iâ€™m Ivan Asipovich
I specialize in modifying and customizing the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations system, focusing on programming in X++ and C# to meet the requirements and needs of users and customers. Since 2023, I have been developing my skills in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce, working with TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML and CSS, and in Dynamics 365 Business Central, programming in AL. I also create software in C# (.NET, .NET Framework, ASP.NET) in close cooperation with Microsoft SQL Server databases. 

I have experience in creating integrations with fiscal printers (Novitus, Posnet) and external systems using REST API and Azure Logic Apps. On a daily basis, I use JIRA, Confluence and GIT/Azure DevOps Server version control systems. I also have experience in web technologies and creating applications in Java (Spring Framework). 

The main professional goal is to develop as a Back-end Developer, combining technical skills with analytical thinking and the desire to create efficient and reliable solutions.
